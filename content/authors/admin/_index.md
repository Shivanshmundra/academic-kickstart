Hello! My name is Shivansh Mundra. I am pre-final year undergraduate student at Indian Instituute of Technology, Kharagpur.

I waste most of my time on internet hopping on things like Machine Learning, Mathematics, Innovations(specificly in Tech) and Philosophies.

I am motivated at regular intervals to try out ideas popping in my mind, but end up most of time watching Netflix!.
