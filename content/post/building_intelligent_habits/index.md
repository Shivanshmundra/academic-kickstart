Hi Everyone, reading this. Right now it's only me. 

So what's this? 

From quite a long amount of time, I am having this problem of distraction. I mean heavy distraction not just some cliche millennial kid making excuses about his underachievement, it's a serious issue. 

I am so much consumed by this dopamine releasing factory also known as social media, I have lost self-respect and confidence. At times, I have tried to counter this habit via numerous tactics but failed every time. It's not just about trying and trying and trying. People have a wrong perception about nailing any thing, **DON'T QUIT!** . To me this is a ridiculous thing, every time you try and fail, you lose a lot. Every time you are inching towards exhaustion, you loose faith in yourself and by time you accept you can't achieve it(yes there are things you can't do), you are null and void from inside. This dual loss is reason for a lot of psychological issues. 


So, Let's change this. Let's bring some confidence and respect for yourself.



## How?

Directly to the point, I have discovered that when you set targets for yourself and achieve them(not completely), it sparks some self-confidence. I tried this with this habit of Brushing at night, it takes the initial effort(a lot effort) to build one. But once it's done, feeling is priceless. 

So let's take this one step forward with right approach, this doc would be my to-do tracker and I will evaluate myself. 



## GOAL IS TO IMPROVE 1% EVERYDAY

Date: 21st April, Entry #1

- [x] Before sleeping today, make sure to code basic model of referring image segmentation.
- [ ] Read blogs about DeepFakes, what is SOTA, how they tackle it. 
- [x] Some Family time too!
- [x] No late night time killing on Social Media or Gaming!

First entry is always easy to crack, anyway let's see how I am doing this!

Hi So it's end of first day, I hope everyday is like first day!

So there are few shortcomings, couldn't properly about DeepFakes and a bit on social media. Can't just detach something which was filled in my mind from a while. 
Plus point - I really learnt today how to create a complex model in PyTorch from  scratch. I was living in a fuggazy world where I was master in Deep Learning. For tomorrow, remember about **1%** improvement.

Date: 22nd April, Entry #2

- [ ] Before afternoon sleep, read DeepForensics++ and other Kaggle kernels.
- [ ] Have a talk with Sumit about server and data issue.
- [ ] Some Family time!
- [ ] Afternoon, Meeting with Sarveshwar 
- [ ] Ask Prof Abir about dilemma faced today in model.
- [ ] If got server, try to run one model from Kaggle else write extensive documentation about literature. 
- [ ] Complete GAN code of Paper with Prof Abir
- [ ] Fooled by Randomness 

Now second day is a bit tougher, spring is compressed. According to my experience, don't try too harsh. Remember it's a long game!
