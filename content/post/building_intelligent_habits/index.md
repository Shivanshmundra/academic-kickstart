Hi Everyone, reading this. Right now it's only me. 

So what's this? 

From quite a long amount of time, I am having this problem of distraction. I mean heavy distraction not just some cliche millennial kid making excuses about his underachievement, it's a serious issue. 

I am so much consumed by this dopamine releasing factory also known as social media, I have lost self-respect and confidence. At times, I have tried to counter this habit via numerous tactics but failed every time. It's not just about trying and trying and trying. People have a wrong perception about nailing any thing, **DON'T QUIT!** . To me this is a ridiculous thing, every time you try and fail, you lose a lot. Every time you are inching towards exhaustion, you loose faith in yourself and by time you accept you can't achieve it(yes there are things you can't do), you are null and void from inside. This dual loss is reason for a lot of psychological issues. 


So, Let's change this. Let's bring some confidence and respect for yourself.



## How?

Directly to the point, I have discovered that when you set targets for yourself and achieve them(not completely), it sparks some self-confidence. I tried this with this habit of Brushing at night, it takes the initial effort(a lot effort) to build one. But once it's done, feeling is priceless. 

So let's take this one step forward with right approach, this doc would be my to-do tracker and I will evaluate myself. 



## GOAL IS TO IMPROVE 1% EVERYDAY

---

Date: 21st April, Entry #1

- [x] Before sleeping today, make sure to code basic model of referring image segmentation.
- [ ] Read blogs about DeepFakes, what is SOTA, how they tackle it. 
- [x] Some Family time too!
- [x] No late night time killing on Social Media or Gaming!

First entry is always easy to crack, anyway let's see how I am doing this!

Hi So it's end of first day, I hope everyday is like first day!

So there are few shortcomings, couldn't properly about DeepFakes and a bit on social media. Can't just detach something which was filled in my mind from a while. 
Plus point - I really learnt today how to create a complex model in PyTorch from  scratch. I was living in a fuggazy world where I was master in Deep Learning. For tomorrow, remember about **1%** improvement. 

---

Date: 22nd April, Entry #2

- [x] Before afternoon sleep, read DeepForensics++ and other Kaggle kernels.
- [x] Have a talk with Sumit about server and data issue.
- [x] Some Family time!
- [x] Afternoon, Meeting with Sarveshwar 
- [x] Ask Prof Abir about dilemma faced today in model.
- [x] If got server, try to run one model from Kaggle else write extensive documentation about literature. 
- [x] Complete GAN code of Paper with Prof Abir
- [ ] Fooled by Randomness 

Now second day is a bit tougher, spring is compressed. According to my experience, don't try too harsh. Remember it's a long game!



Hey There! So I almost made my second day as well. Today I coded for 3 hrs straight and completed the GAN code(almost). I couldn't code from Kaggle and also couldn't read novel. This method is really good, you can actually see what you have done the whole day. Oh..Yeah on an additional part I wrote a blog about the paper I read. So planning on next day, I have some concrete goals. One of them is to be efficient in using PyTorch/Tensorflow. Anyway, I guess I did improve 1 %, it's time for next day. Be extra careful of nor getting burned out tomorrow, now I am entering phase which is most difficult, the peak in any habit cultivation graph.



---

Date: 23rd April, Entry #3

- [ ] Understand that Kaggle kernel, how it was doing fake image detection
- [x] Try to implement dlib for any face image and also xception feature extraction for image
- [x] Family time, a little more!
- [x] Talk with Prof. Abir and Sanjay about code and ask Sanjay to help
- [x] Read about more papers on fake image detection
- [ ] Continue with next RL lecture/ Read paper sent by Sriyash 

Don't loose here, it's the peak, try to complete most of it. Remember it's a long game and 1% improvement daily.

---

Date: 24th April, Entry #4

So here it is a day late, and almost crashed as always in the peak but not because I came here to confront it. So I was exhausted a lot and tried to escape this using dopamine releasing industry. All motivation faded and on the top of that, surroundings were also playing against me. Didn't do a lot of work not of intern not personal. But yeah I guess this cycle can't be broken this easily, I didn't improve 1% this day not the day after it :cry:. 

So, is it like always ? **FUCK NO**  Not this time, this is a long process and I am going under this change so it is natural to experience such issues. Never mind, stabilise yourself and keep your head straight. 

What to do tomorrow?

- [x] Understand FaceForensics++ dataset, how it is created.
- [ ] Try to use exception to extract features and reproduce results on same data as MesoNet
- [x] See if you can create a short data by yourself from deepfakes or similar thing
- [x] Debug this code of GAN, too important, having a lot of difficulty though..FML!
- [ ] Read that paper by Sriyash
- [x] Understand fully how tokenization works and LSTM connections to understand that code
- [x] Family Time!
- [ ] No Social Media for the day, if necessary read book



ACE IT BUDDY!

Dude, it's getting too tough on me, again a day break. Feeling like giving up on both this trail/idea and me. I guess this happens in a cycle with me. A peak and then a downfall. I have realised I am only being motivated from someone else's success. This was not how I wanted me to be!

Took a lot of efforts from my side, but there is one thing very certain about me. I don't give up, AT ALL!

So again going through this, I have improved more than 1% for sure this week and chill it's just 1st week

Date: 27th April, Entry #5

- [ ] Setup either your own pc or in remote for datasets on fake image detection
- [ ] Try to complete that code by extracting features from faces and coding for binary classification.
- [ ] Take update with Sanjay about how this thing is working
- [ ] Meeting with Abir Sir
- [ ] Meeting with Sumit and tell about how things are progressing -data and everything!
- [ ] Update Sarveshwar about shitty internet and lagging vm
- [ ] Famiy Time(don't just tick if you haven't done!)
- [ ] Revision of Algo!



For motivation : 

When things go wrong as they sometimes will,
When the road you're trudging seems all up hill,
When the funds are low and the debts are high
And you want to smile, but you have to sigh,
When care is pressing you down a bit,
Rest if you must, but don't you quit.
Life is strange with its twists and turns
As every one of us sometimes learns
And many a failure comes about
When he might have won had he stuck it out;
Don't give up though the pace seems slow—
You may succeed with another blow.
Success is failure turned inside out—
The silver tint of the clouds of doubt,
And you never can tell just how close you are,
It may be near when it seems so far;
So stick to the fight when you're hardest hit—
It's when things seem worst that you must not quit
